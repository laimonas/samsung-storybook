Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) to view it in the browser.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

To run storybook after installed dependencies and peer-dependencies, run

### `npm run start`

Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build-storybook`

installs dependencies, peer-dependencies and build storybook

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

##### `npm i git+ssh://git@git.syzygy.de:samsung/pmc-2/development/storybook.git#yourBranchName`


###### Required Dependencies

# Release Management

- After finishing your feature, update version nr in package.json
- create pull  request and obtain a review.
- merge pull request into main (delete source branch)
- create new tag on main https://git.syzygy.de/samsung/pmc-2/development/storybook/-/tags. Same version from package.json must be used when naming the tag (e.g. v0.9.4)
- add release notes like: fixes, components, peer dependencies
- send a notification in the development channel that there is a new version of the storybook which the dependence

# CI

CI is configured to run for merge requets, tags as well as the default branch

# When to run scripts

## Fonts
To generate inline-base64-fonts run `npm run gen:inline-fonts` every time you add new fonts or reference them

## Icons

To generate SVGR importable SVG react components please run `npm run gen:svgr` every time you add new fonts to scope. All SVGR components accept prop `currentColor` which will replace default black (#000)
